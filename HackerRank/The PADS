For DB2 :

SELECT Name || '(' || LEFT(Occupation,1) || ')'
FROM OCCUPATIONS
ORDER BY Name;
SELECT 'There are a total of '|| COUNT(Occupation) || ' ' || LOWER(Occupation) || 's.'
FROM OCCUPATIONS
GROUP BY Occupation
ORDER BY COUNT(Occupation),Occupation;

For MySQL :

SELECT CONCAT(Name,'(',SUBSTRING(Occupation,1,1),')')
FROM OCCUPATIONS
ORDER BY Name;
SELECT CONCAT('There are a total of ',COUNT(Occupation),' ',LOWER(Occupation),'s.' )
FROM OCCUPATIONS
GROUP BY Occupation
ORDER BY COUNT(Occupation),Occupation;
